# brainfuck

this repo is for a brainfuck program, which calculates the first 250 primes. unfortunately the brainfuck code is more than 140MB in size, so i had to put it in a zip to upload it. the zip also contains an exe, so you don't have to compile the program yourself. the output of the program isn't adjusted for ascii/unicode, so if you see an 'a', then that means, that the ascii-number of 'a' (97) is one of the primes.
