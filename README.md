# brainfuck

this repo is for a brainfuck program, which calculates all the primes between 2 and 250. unfortunately the brainfuck code is more than 140MB in size, so i had to put it in a zip to upload it. the zip also contains an exe, so you don't have to compile the program yourself. your windows defender might warn you, saying that the exe is actually a virus, but it is actually just the code compiled using "infrabuck". the output of the program isn't adjusted for ascii/unicode, so if you see an 'a', then that means, that the ascii-number of 'a' (97) is one of the primes.
